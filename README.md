👋 Hi there 😊

I’m Hana ╰(*°▽°*)╯. I’m introduced to coding since February 2022💻. I’m currently learning html, css (bootstrap), javascript (vue.js, node js, asynchronous js, jquery), python & ui/ux (specifically figma)👩‍💻.

A Snippet on my Bio: I'm graduated in science stream in 2018, worked in clinical-retail industry👓 for 4 years (i sell my knowledge, service and product), had experience with volunteerism and placed 2nd for 3-minutes-presentation on my thesis degree. March-May 2022 (3 months) i enrolled in mentorship trading class🚀 (kinda the wall street movie(buy n sell stocks))📈.


What i am looking for:
- I’m looking to collaborate with the community. 
- I'm still practicing to use git correctly (ಥ_ಥ) (crying..). Git is hard but i am surviving👌. 
- You can reach me at [![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/_Hans999_.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40_Hans999_)](https://twitter.com/_Hans999_)  
(I'm quite active chirping!🙈)


Have a nice day!
