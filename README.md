👋 Hi there 😊

I’m Hana ╰(*°▽°*)╯. I’m interested newbie in coding👩‍💻. I'm graduated in science stream in 2018 but I’m currently learning html, css, javascript, python & ui/ux design. I'm still practicing to use git ಥ_ಥ (crying..). Git is hard but i am surviving👌. 

What i am looking for:
- I’m looking to collaborate with github community. 
- You can reach me at [![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/_Hans999_.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40_Hans999_)](https://twitter.com/_Hans999_)

Have a nice day!
