👋 Hi there 😊

I’m Hana ╰(*°▽°*)╯. I’m interested newbie in coding👩‍💻. I'm graduated in science stream in 2018, worked in clinical-retail industry for 4 years, had experience with volunteerism and placed 2nd for 3-minutes-presentation on my thesis degree. I’m currently learning html, css, javascript (bootstrap, jquery), python & ui/ux (figma). 

What i am looking for:
- I’m looking to collaborate with the community. 
- I'm still practicing to use git correctly (ಥ_ಥ) (crying..). Git is hard but i am surviving👌. 
- You can reach me at [![Twitter URL](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/_Hans999_.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40_Hans999_)](https://twitter.com/_Hans999_)  
(I'm quite active there🙈)

Have a nice day!
