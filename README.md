👋 Hi there 😊

I’m currently learning html, css (bootstrap), javascript (vue.js, node js, asynchronous js, jquery), python, ui/ux (figma), kotlin📱, back-end, SQL, basic devops intro and linux.👩‍💻  I'm trying to learn a lot of thing in order to grasp my preferrences to focus on. And it means i need to try lots of things in a little bit details to have a clearer picture. Wish me luck!🥷
